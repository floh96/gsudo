## Sponsor gsudo

Hi, I'm Gerardo, a seasoned software developer from Argentina with a journey in programming that began at the age of 15. My passion for technology led me to create 'gsudo', an open-source project that enhances the windows desktop.

Through sponsorship, you can help sustain the ongoing development of 'gsudo', including keeping it updated, adding new features, and potentially kickstarting new projects. Your support will address practical needs like covering code-signing certificate costs and other expenses, enabling me to focus on innovation and development.

`gsudo` is delivered as a signed application. This ensures the UAC popup doesn't show "Untrusted Publisher", and protects end users detect that gsudo binaries hadnÂ´t been altered.

On Nov 2022, [Parag Mehta @parag_c_mehta](https://twitter.com/gerardo_gr/status/1595817336405168134) gifted me a code signing certificate which expires in Nov 2025. We have some months left to collect $632 for another [3 year renewal](https://signmycode.com/code-signing-certificates).
